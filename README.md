# 🐢 Turtle-River-Crossing-Adventure
A fun, beginner-friendly arcade game built using Python's Turtle graphics module. Inspired by the classic *Frogger*, this game challenges players to help a turtle cross a river by dodging lots of floating logs, leveling up, and trying not to become turtle soup!

- Press **R** to restart after game over.
- Press **Enter** to start the game from the intro screen.
